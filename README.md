<strong>Passion Project Final Version </strong></br>
NBA Injury App </br>
I made an injury application for the NBA, you can track what players have what injury and it descriped the injury and how long they can be out for. </br>
The database consist of three tables: Teams, Players and Injuries </br>
The application demonstrates a full MVP functionality with CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) for each of the tables. </br>
Additionally, the extra feature I chose to do was an image upload but i created it for Teams and Players, so it looked more finished. </br>
